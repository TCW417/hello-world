# hello-world

Readme file created as part of initial tutorial on use of GitHub

Greetings Humans!

I've been readng a series of novels about humans talking with dolphins and gorillas through translation software. 

This is the readme file for my very first Git repository. 

I'm learning to use Git in advance of taking a coding class. I'm hoping to get back into tech after a long hiatis.
